## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (For Interviews)

**30-Second Version:**
"I built a comprehensive Workforce Planning Analytics Dashboard that helps HR teams make data-driven decisions. It processes over 10,000 employee records, provides 20 interactive visualizations, and generates strategic recommendations. I deployed it on Streamlit Cloud and it's live now - would you like to see it?"

**60-Second Version:**
"I identified that HR teams often struggle with fragmented data and lack actionable insights for workforce planning. So I built an interactive analytics dashboard using Python and Streamlit. 

The dashboard processes 9 different HR datasets - everything from employee demographics to performance reviews - and provides comprehensive analysis across 5 key areas: overall metrics, demographics, attrition, performance, and strategic insights.

What makes it unique is the AI-powered recommendations engine that compares your data against industry benchmarks and suggests actionable improvements with ROI calculations. I deployed it to Streamlit Cloud so it's accessible anywhere, and set up auto-deployment so any updates I push to GitHub automatically go live.

It demonstrates my full-stack data analytics skills - from data processing and visualization to deployment and user experience design."
