# Employee Attrition Prediction and Retention Strategy Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is one of the most expensive challenges for organizations.  
Replacing an employee involves hiring costs, training time, and productivity loss.

This project uses the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset** to analyze workforce data and uncover:
- Patterns behind employee attrition
- Key factors influencing employee retention
- High-risk employee segments

The focus of this project is **data analytics and visualization**, with strong emphasis on **business insights** rather than just predictive modeling.
