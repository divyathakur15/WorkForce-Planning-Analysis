# Employee Attrition Prediction and Retention Strategy Dashboard

## Project Idea

Employee attrition is a critical challenge faced by organizations across industries.  
When experienced employees leave unexpectedly, it leads to higher recruitment costs, loss of organizational knowledge, reduced productivity, and disruption in team performance.

This project is based on the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset** and focuses on analyzing historical employee data to understand:
- Why employees leave organizations
- Which employee groups are at higher risk of attrition
- What factors contribute most to employee retention

The project goes beyond simple reporting and aims to transform employee data into **actionable workforce insights**.

By analyzing employee demographics, job roles, tenure, satisfaction levels, and performance indicators, this project supports HR teams and management in making **proactive retention decisions**.

This is a **complete data analytics project**, covering:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- KPI creation
- Insight generation
- Dashboard development for business users
